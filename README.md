## Protocol
The protocol is available [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/grp-ehr/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BEF4D8C0D-B811-4A56-9A03-030E6A32DCC5%7D&file=post-covid-vaccinated.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) (currently restricted access).

## Repository navigation
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).

* Analyses scripts are in the `analysis/` directory:
    * If you are interested in how we defined our variables, we use three study definition scripts to define two cohorts: vaccinated and electively vaccinated. In both cases, patient index date could be defined as EITHER the study start date (i.e., index) OR a dynamic date (vaccinated: two weeks post second vaccination; electively unvaccinated: twelve weeks post eligibility). Hence, we have a study definition for each ([study definition index](analysis/study_definition_index.py), [study definition vaccinated](analysis/study_definition_vaccinated.py), [study definition electively unvaccinated](analysis/study_definition_electively_unvaccinated.py)); this is written in `python`. Extracted data is then combined to create our final cohorts, one for vaccinated and one for electively unvaccinated, in the [preprocess data script](analysis/preprocess_data.R).
    * This directory also contains all the R scripts that process, describe, and analyse the extracted data.

* The `lib/` directory contains a list of active analyses.

* The `project.yaml` defines run-order and dependencies for all the analysis scripts. This file should not be edited directly. To make changes to the yaml, edit and run the `create_project_actions.R` script (available in the `analysis/` directory) which generates all the actions of the `project.yaml`.

* Descriptive and Model outputs, including figures and tables are in the `released_outputs/` directory.
